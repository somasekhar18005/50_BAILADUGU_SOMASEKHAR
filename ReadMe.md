🚀 Autonomous Multi-Agent Task Orchestrator

Supervity Hackathon 2026

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an autonomous multi-agent system where multiple AI agents collaborate to plan, execute, and validate complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

The system is designed to mimic real-world enterprise workflows, where tasks are broken down, executed, and reviewed systematically.

🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional AI chatbots respond to single prompts but fail to:

Handle multi-step tasks autonomously

Validate the quality of generated outputs

Scale to enterprise workflow automation

There is a need for agent-based systems that can reason, coordinate, and validate tasks end-to-end.

💡 Solution

We built an Autonomous Multi-Agent Task Orchestrator consisting of specialized AI agents that work together to complete tasks efficiently.

Key Highlights:

Autonomous task decomposition

Agent-to-agent collaboration

Validation for enterprise-grade reliability

Final Output

🤖 Agents Description
1️⃣ Planner Agent

Understands the user’s goal

Breaks the goal into structured sub-tasks

2️⃣ Executor Agent

Executes tasks generated by the planner

Produces actionable outputs (content, summaries, checklists, etc.)

3️⃣ Validator Agent

Reviews executor outputs

Improves quality and ensures correctness

Simulates enterprise-level validation

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

AI: LLM APIs

Concepts: Multi-Agent Systems, Prompt Engineering

Frameworks: Lightweight (FastAPI / Streamlit – optional)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

▶️ How It Works

User provides a high-level task or goal

Planner agent decomposes the task

Executor agent completes each sub-task

Validator agent reviews and refines the output

Final validated response is returned to the user



🚀 Future Enhancements

Human-in-the-loop approvals

Agent failure recovery & retry logic

Workflow visualization dashboard

Enterprise system integrations

🏁 Hackathon Note

This project was developed as part of the Supervity Hackathon 2026, focusing on agent-based automation, system thinking, and enterprise AI concepts.
